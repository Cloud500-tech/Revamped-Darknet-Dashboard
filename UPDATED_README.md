# Darknet Leak Detector
*A Simulated Darknet Data Leak Detection Dashboard*  
(Flask API + React/Tailwind Frontend)

This project simulates a darknet monitoring system for academic and research purposes.
It consists of:

- A **Python backend (Flask)** that loads synthetic darknet leaks, analyzes patterns, and exposes structured API endpoints.
- A **React + Tailwind dashboard** that visualizes leaks through analytics, charts, tables, and on-demand reports.
- A **Figma-styled UI** integrated into a cybersecurity-themed interface.

No real darknet data is accessed. All data is synthetic and generated for educational use only.

# 🔧 Features

### Backend (Python / Flask)
- Synthetic darknet leak generator
- Leak detection engine with:
  - Severity scoring
  - Risk classification
  - Pattern extraction
- JSON + CSV dataset support
- CSV export of **all leaks**
- Summary endpoint for dashboard analytics

### Frontend (React / Vite / Tailwind)
- Interactive cyber-style dashboard UI
- Analytics: severity, sources, patterns, timelines
- Live threat feed
- Report generation with timestamps
- CSV export per report
- CSV export of full leak dataset

# 🚀 How to Run the Darknet Leak Detector

This system requires **two terminals**:
one for the Backend (Flask) and one for the Frontend (React).

## 1. Start the Backend (Flask API)

From the project root:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python api.py
```

If it loads successfully, you’ll see:

```
Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Keep this terminal open.

---

## 2. Start the Frontend (React Dashboard)

Open a **second terminal**:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

You will see:

```
Local: http://localhost:3000
```

Open that URL to access the dashboard UI.

## Quick Summary

### Terminal 1
```bash
cd backend
python api.py
```

### Terminal 2
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

- Dashboard runs at: **http://localhost:3000**
- Backend API runs at: **http://127.0.0.1:8000**

# 🧪 Generate Synthetic Darknet Data (Optional)

To generate hundreds of realistic synthetic leaks (for testing charts and reports):

```bash
cd backend
python generate_synthetic_data.py
python api.py   # restart backend
```

This overwrites:
- `sample_data.json`
- `sample_data.csv`

The dashboard will automatically reflect the new dataset.

# 🗂️ API Endpoints

| Endpoint          | Description                        |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| `/api/summary`    | Returns leak summary analytics     |
| `/api/leaks`      | Returns all leaks (JSON)           |
| `/api/leaks_csv`  | Downloads full leak dataset (CSV)  |
| `/api/ping`       | Health check                       |

# 📝 Project Purpose

This project was developed as part of a university senior project to demonstrate:

- Darknet intelligence simulation
- Data-driven threat analytics
- Dashboard UI/UX design
- Full-stack integration (Python backend + React frontend)

It is not intended for real-world threat intelligence or monitoring.

# 🔒 Disclaimer

This tool uses **synthetic data only**.
It **does not** access, scrape, or monitor the real darknet.
